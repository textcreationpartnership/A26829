            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Early beloved, ſeeing we are bound, by the deare love of Chriſt, not to conceal the mind of Chriſt, and that we are not our own, but every one bound by the bond of dear affection, to tender the good one of another, not onely in temporall, and common affairs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in ſpirituall and celeſtiall matters; and not to retain as churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> but rather diſpence as <hi>Booz,</hi> unto <hi>Ruth;</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:97216:3"/>therefore upon the aforeſaid conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions am determined according to the ſtrength and power which Chriſt hath given unto me, to bring to the view of the Saints, this heavenly Doctrine of free grace, of vocation by the Spirit, of Adoption, of Mediation by the Lord of life, and glory; of Reconciliation by his blood; of ſanctification, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; of union through faith and love, and of glorification through that ſweet communion which we ſhall injoy in him who is the Lord of life and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ever. To whom ſhall I preſent theſe lines? except to you who know the myſterie of life and ſalvation, who are heires and coheires with God in Chriſt, who have intereſt in all that is the Fathers, and Jeſus Chriſts whom he hath ſent, and walke in the light, as Chriſt is the light of truth, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. I am perſwaded of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire loves and affections to the Word of life and ſalvation; and that nothing is ſo dear unto you as to heare of the praiſe of your beloved. In the true knowledge of what is Chriſts, conſiſts the true ſolace of heart, joy in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and contentment of mind. What
<pb facs="tcp:97216:3"/>joy? what peace? what conſolation can be without this knowledge? that God communicates to his grace, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving: that they are called from the kingdome of Satan, to the kingdome of Chriſt: that they who were ſlaves, and captives of hell, are made the brethren of Chriſt, that they are united to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Chriſt, from whom they receive their being, and well-being, that they are ſanctified by the Spirit of life, which frees them from the law of ſinne, and death; that they are clothed with the royall robes of Chriſt, and that they ſhall for ever dwell with Chriſt, in the heavenly Jeruſalem. This fountain is as Gileads balme, and Damaſcus rivers; As a continuall ſpring, of the ſweeteſt repaſt: as a fountaine of over-flowing pleaſures, and the delightſome delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the faithfull. Hath eyes ſeen, hath eares heard, or mind conceived the admirable joyes, that God hath laid up for them that love him? or hath eye ſeen, eare heard, or mind conceived the ſingular conſolation which comes from the knowledge of theſe to the Saints through the hand of a Mediator?

            <p>O the height of favour, O the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of love, O the breadth of grace, and the longitude of free immenſe, and in comprehenſe mercie of God to his poore ſervants, that the clouds are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, the miſts and foggs of darkneſſe diſperſed, and the Saints behold the mirror of divine glory in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt!

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The prevenient grace of God is, that through which God loves his, in the beloved, without any reſpect to any merits or deſervings in his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, 1. Joh. 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The concomitant grace of God is that whereby he doth continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his own with ſweet communion with himſelf in the day of grace, and perfect fruition, and communion with his Chriſt in the eternall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 1. Joh. 1.3. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, that declare we unto you, that ye may have communion with us, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſubſequent and prevenient grace of God are all one, and the ſame, onely they differ in reſpect of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Operating grace is that, which changeth the mind, will, and affection.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97216:8"/>Cooperating grace is that which makes the Saints move to Godward, when the will is changed 1. Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Phil. 4.13. <hi>I am able to do all things through Christ which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The grace of Chriſt is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he diſpenſeth abundantly to the Saints from the overflowing and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace enwrapt within himſelf; and procureth for his eternall favour, through which they are ever beloved of his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all we receive, grace for grace.</hi> Jude 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God, waiting for the mercie of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſupereminencie of divine grace and bountie is declared, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, union, and ſalvation of the unworthie, and immeriting. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>That he might ſhew, in the ages to come, the ſupereminent riches of his grace, according to his bountie towards us in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Grace is propoſed unto all, in the Goſpel of life, and reconciliation, but made effectuall to none but the Saints,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97216:9"/>beleeving; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Word profited them not, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in them which heard it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. The fruits of holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe mediately are produced, by the Saints communion with Chriſt; and immediately by grace, the cauſe of everlaſting hope and reconciliation. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If we ſay we have communion with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we make him a lyar, and there is no truth in us.</hi> Tit. 2.11. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation to all men, hath appeared,</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to deny ungodlineſſe, and worldly luſts, and to live chaſtly, godly, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, in this preſent world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. The collocation of ineſtimable and unſpeakable graces abounded in Chriſt, ſith he was anointed with the oyl of gladneſſe above his fellows, and the Spirit was not given to him by meaſure, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. <hi>For he whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the words of God, for God giveth him not the Spirit by meaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. There is an inſeparable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the grace of God and the ſatiſfaction of the Lord Chriſt, ſith the Lord Chriſt hath no otherwiſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97216:9"/>life and ſalvation by his merit or ſatisfaction, ſave by the favour or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure of his Father. Luk. 22.42. <hi>Father if thou wilt take this cup from me, nevertheleſſe, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> Joh 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeved on him might not periſh, but have eternall life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. There is an inſeparable bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and the pleaſure of God the Father. Hence whatſoever the Lord Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, it is his Fathers pleaſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34 <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. The ineſtimable grace of God, which is collocated in the Lord Jeſus, and from him effectually beſtowed on the Saints redeemed, cannot utterly be aboliſhed or extinguiſhed. Rom. 8.39. <hi>Neither height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Lord Chriſt by the grace of ſupplyment, doth ſupplie the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of his hope, in the eſtate of love and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97216:10"/>mercy, and by the grace of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth crown his peculiar with the fruition of glorious and full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the eſtate of glory, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who is made unto us wiſdom of God, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption; Which is his body, the complement of him who filleth all in all.</hi> Epheſ. 1.23.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Anſwerable to the act of faith pitching upon God the Father in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Chriſt, ſo is the gracious injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſence of Gods free mercie, and benevolence in Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> 18. <hi>That being rooted, and grounded in love, ye may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is the breadth, and the length, and the depth, and the height.</hi> 19. <hi>And to know the love of Christ which paſſeth all knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulneſſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Pacification of ſpirit, and peace of conſcience ariſeth, whileſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſt on Gods fatherly indulgencie, being certainly perſwaded that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they do according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is accepted in the hands of Chriſt Mediatour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Vnto the praiſe and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97216:10"/>glory of his grace, whereby he hath freely accepted us in his beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. The effects of divine grace and favour, are the remiſſion of ſins, the imputation of righteouſneſſe, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit of peace and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and everlaſting bleſſedneſſe in the kingdom of hope and fruition. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God hath choſen us from the beginning unto ſalvation by ſanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth.</hi> 14. <hi>Now the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt and God; even our Father which hath loved us, and given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Chriſt died for the ſins of his Saints, and is riſen again for their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and juſtification; ſo that he is not onely become our ſalvation, but his Father is gracious, and propitious to us for his ſake. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>He was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our offences, and raiſed again for our justification.</hi> Matth. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. As by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> we were eſtranged from God, and deſtinated to deſtruction: ſo by the obedience of Chriſt we are received into favour, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97216:11"/>imputed righteous to juſtification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one man many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one man many were made righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. God began to imbrace through free favour whom he loved freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world: then it appeared apparently when he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled us to himſelf through the precious blood of his beloved Son. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4.13. <hi>Through his great love wherewith he loved us, now in Christ Jeſus, ye who were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time afar off, hath he made nigh by the blood of his Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. God through his benevolence hath not onely given the body of Chriſt, but the ſoul of Chriſt, to feel the ſence of his wrath for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind; that although we were loſt, we might be found; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though through the law we could hear nothing but condemnation; yet now through Chriſt we may hear the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſalvation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10 <hi>For as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are of the works of the Law are under the curſe: for it is written, Curſed is every one that abideth not in all things which are written in the Law to do them.</hi> 2. Tim. 1.10. <hi>But now is made manifeſt by the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97216:11"/>coming of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and brought in life, and immortalitie into light by the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. In this hath appeared the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe love of God towards men; whileſt he was ſent into the world for their deliverie; whileſt he was made a ſacrifice to pacifie the wrath of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was ſo hot againſt them. 1. Joh. 4.10 <hi>In this is love, not that we have loved God; but that he hath loved us, and hath ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. God was moſt clementious, and propitious in the beloved Chriſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the Redeemer of humane ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; whileſt the beloved Chriſt was willing to redeeme them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.6, 7. <hi>Burnt-offerings and ſacrifice thou wouldeſt not for ſin: then ſaid I, behold I come. In the volume of thy book it is w itten of me, that I ſhould do thy will, O God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. The free grace of God is the ſtay of the mind, the prop of the ſoul, and the hope of the conſcience, in the midſt of all ſorrow and tribulations. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>This call I to mind therefore have I hope: It is the Lords mercy we are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97216:12"/>not conſumed: but his compaſſions fail not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. If any man ſhall ſet himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunall ſeat of an angry God, he ſhall not ſtand; being there is nothing in him that may merit favour, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve love at the hands of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If Jah ſhall obſerve iniquities, O Lord who ſhall ſtand!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Chriſt through his obedience hath obtained favour, he hath ſatisfied for our ſins; he hath born the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us; and through his obedience God is well pleaſed. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in him.</hi>

                  <p>O Chriſtian, look to the Rock from whence thou art hewen; and to the hole of the pit from whence thou art digged: all that thou receiveſt is from free favour and grace of a loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; had he not favoured thee, where hadſt thou remained? or where hadſt thou been? aſſuredly in the bottomleſſe pit, under the heat of everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, bound by the black ſwadle bands
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97216:12"/>of the devill; lockt up under the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of darkneſſe to the judgement of the great day; arraigned by the power of juſtice, and condemned by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, never to have heard the ſweet ſound of reconciliation; or the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harmony of the gracious doctrine of redemption, except the bowels of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing mercie had yearned, and the gracious countenance of thy loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been manifeſted: The clouds open, and diſtill their drops, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and repleniſhing of the ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie creature. Thy gracious Father hath yearned by the bowels of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and hath repleniſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed thy ſoule with his abundant kindneſſe. Thy dayes might have been dayes of ſorrow, and thy nights nights of terrour: The terrours of death, the horrors of hell; and the afrightment of a wofull conſcience might have ſadded thee, had not free love and ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace prevented: Is not his grace better to thee then kingdomes? then Conſulſhips? then riches? then Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? then dignities? or dominions? The Diſciples wondred at the rare and famous buildings of the Temple, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97216:13"/>mayeſt not thou wonder at the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and incomparableneſſe of the free grace of God thy celeſtiall Father?

Did the babe ſpring in the wombe of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at <hi>Maries</hi> ſalutation? and doth not joy ſpring in my conſcience, becauſe of free grace in everlaſting redemption? Here is grace incomparable, here is mercie ineffable, and here is bountie unalterable; is not this the River from whence my ſoul hath water? is not this the Sunne from whence my mind hath light? is not this the heart from whence my will recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth vitall motion?

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning Election.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ELection is the ſelecting or chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſome certain men, that the glorious and ſupereminent grace of God may be manifeſted upon them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>That he might declare the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his glory upon the veſſels of mercie, which he hath prepared unto glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God in the election of free grace wils the glory of the riches of his grace, and the everlaſting benediction of his people. Hence he hath diſpoſed a way for them, that they may come to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life and benediction. Epheſ. 1.5, 6. <hi>Who hath predeſtinated us unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of ſons by Jeſus Christ in himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the praiſe of the glory of his grace, whereby he hath made us freely accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is not the meritorious or impulſive cauſe of election, nothing in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97216:14"/>election muſt be conſidered, but the meer and free goodneſſe of God our heavenly Father. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>In him, I ſay, in whom we have obtained lot, whilest we were predestinated according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of him who worketh all things after the counſell of his own will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fruition of glorious ſalvation is founded on the free mercie and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a loving God; the matter upon the obedience or ſatisfaction of Chriſt the inſtrument is faith, and the end is the glory or illuſtration of divine mercie. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>As he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we may be holy, and unblameable before him in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The elect can never fall finally or totally from grace received, ſith in Chriſt their grace is founded, and that Gods love to them in Chriſt cannot be altered. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10. <hi>For the mountains ſhall remove, and the hils ſhall fall down, but my mercy ſhall not depart from thee; neither ſhall the covenant of my peace fall away, ſaith the Lord, that hath compaſſion on thee.</hi> Rom. 8. laſt verſe, <hi>Neither height, nor depth, nor any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To the Elect is given the ſound and ſolid knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent; ſith that to them is not onely given the knowledge of the letter, but alſo the revelation of the myſtery of God &amp; Chriſt, through the Spirit. Coloſ. 1.27. <hi>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this myſterie among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi>

                  <p>BEfore man had a being, God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to man through love the being and well-being of every creature; He ſingled Angels to ſtand in the eſtate of puritie, and man to ſtand in the eſtate of innocencie and integritie; Love choſe us before we were choſen; Love im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced us before we loved. Much was given to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe loved much; much is given to the Saints before they loved; before we were the children of wrath, we were the children of mercie, and whileſt we were the children of mercy, we became the children of wrath; we were that we are not; through love we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97216:15"/>are that we were not; not for beautie, amiableneſſe, or comelineſſe, not for works, doings, and performances; not for riches, honours, or dignities, are we choſen to ſalvation. Our ſilver became droſſe, our excellencie became a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of iniquitie; and our glory was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impuritie. The Father of mercie moved in mercie, ſhewed mercie, and yearning in the bowels of compaſſion, incompaſſed poor ſouls with dear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions: when they were in their blood he ſaid unto them, Live; when they lay wallowing in their blood, he made them live for ever; they were received when the righteous were refuſed; the poore prodigals are received in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, when the ſelf-conceited are deſpiſed. The lovelieſt ſtarres and the choiſeſt cedars were choſen for the building of the Temple; the pooreſt ſpirits, and the captives of hope, are choſen to be temples of the holy Ghoſt: Oh my ſoul, thou art become a child of bountie, through bountie; and a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of glorie through the riches of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie: thy Father delighted in thee when thou hadſt no delight in him; he loved thee when thou hadſt no love to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97216:15"/>him, and gave thee the right hand of fellowſhip and communion, when thou ſtoodeſt not related to Godward, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or union. Fear nothing, O my ſoul, what though thou art not famous, nor glorious in the world? what though thou poſſeſſeſt not the riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof? what though no eye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven ſhew pitie or compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee? yet thy God will extend the bowels of that his tender bountie towards thee. Art thou not choſen of mercie, to expreſſe mercie? and a veſſell of glorie, to expreſſe the riches of his glorie? thou art choſen to be that thou wouldeſt be, and denied to be that thou wouldeſt not be; denied to be a child of wrath, and death, and choſen to be an heire of mercie, and life. What wilt thou give to God for ſo great a kindnes? what wilt thou render to God for ſo great a favour? though thou canſt not anſwer mercie; yet declare of mercie: and though thou wanteſt in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of favour, yet declare and expreſſe the favour of thy loving God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23. <hi>Who remembred us in our baſe eſtate, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

                     <hi>THe Covenant of grace, is the free promiſe of God in Chriſt Jeſus, through which he ſtrongly aſſureth his choſen people, that he wil be their God, and they ſhall be his people.</hi> Jer. <hi>31.31, 32, 33. The 31. verſe,</hi> Behold, the daies come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah. <hi>The 32.</hi> Not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which my Covenant they break, although I was an husband unto them, ſaith the Lord. <hi>The 33.</hi> But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts: and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</p>

                  <head>The difference betwixt the old and the new Covenant.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Under the old they had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt to come; we the teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that Chriſt is come. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. <hi>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jeſus Christ; not by water onely, but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that beareth witneſſe, becauſe the Spirit is truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They had the time of infancie and bondage; we the time of freedome, and the ſpirit of adoption. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4 5, 6. The 5. <hi>To redeeme them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſons.</hi> The 6. <hi>And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In old time it was made known onely to one people; in our time, to all Nations under heaven <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.1. <hi>Sing O barren, thou that didſt not beare: breake forth into ſinging, and cry aloud, thou that didſt not travell with child; for more are the children of the deſolate, then the children of the married wife, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Rom. 10.6, 7, 8. <hi>But the righteouſneſſe which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe; Say not in thine
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97216:17"/>heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven? that is to bring Christ down from above.</hi> 7. <hi>Or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? that is to bring Chriſt again from the dead.</hi> 8. <hi>But what ſaith it, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They had the grace of God dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obſcurely; we plainly, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding, as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The communication or gifts of the Spirit under the Goſpel of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, are more excellent then thoſe which have been communicated under the Law. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17, 18. the 17. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in the last dayes (ſaith God) I will poure out of my Spirit upon all leſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi> The 18. <hi>And on my ſervants, and on my hand-maids, I will poure out in thoſe dayes of my Spirit, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The old Covenant was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> this by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97216:17"/>
                     <hi>For the Law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The old Covenant binds us over to abſolute righteouſnes; the new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to ſeek it in Chriſt the Lord our righteouſneſſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and beleeveth on him, may have everlaſting life; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Rom. 3.26. <hi>To declare I ſay at this time his righteouſneſſe: that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. The old Covenant was given to impell men to Chriſt; the new to hold forth and exhibite Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternall life; and they are they which teſtifie of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The proper object of the old was to conſternate and humble; the new to comfort them who are conſternated, and humbled. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavie laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> 29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye ſhall find rest unto your ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. They differ by accident, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97216:18"/>through our infirmitie, for the Law without the Goſpel is inſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in as much as it was weak through the fleſh; God ſending his own Son in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Lord Chriſt is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the new Covenant, not onely becauſe the Covenant is made with his for his ſake; but becauſe through the vertue of his mediation, this Covenant cannot be diſanulled. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.6.9. <hi>But now hath he obtained a more excellent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, by how much alſo he is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of a better Covenant, which was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> 9 <hi>Not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, becauſe they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. The ſupereminent, ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and ſuperexcellent grace of God, our dear and propitious Father, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to his poore ſervants, in that he hath eſtabliſhed the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of free grace and mercie in the hand of Chriſt Mediatour. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97216:18"/>
                     <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi> Hebr. 9.15. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the new Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternall inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. The Covenant of grace is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting and perpetuall Covenant, ſith the foundation of that Covenant is the free grace of God; and the ratification and confirmation of the ſame is the blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.24. <hi>And to Jeſus the Mediatour of the new Covenant, and to the blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. The ſupereminence of divine grace and favour hath not only appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, that he hath eſtabliſhed this Covenant in the hand of a Mediatour; but alſo in this, that he hath ſmitten a Covenant with the immeriting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. the laſt; <hi>And I will ſowe her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercie upon her, that had not obtained mercie: and I will ſay to them which were not my people, Thou art my people: and they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97216:19"/>ſhall ſay, thou art my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. The grace of God is the ground; the blood of Chriſt the matter; the end, eternall life and beatitude, made over to the faithfull in all ages, that they might be certainly and fully aſſured that God will be their God and Father everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever: yea I will betroth thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in righteouſneſſe, and in judgement, and in loving kindneſſe, and in mercie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. The true and ſolid knowledge of this free Covenant of grace &amp; bountie, cauſeth the beloved Saints and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to hate all Phariſaicall performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the righteouſneſſe of Juſticiaries. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteouſneſſe which is of God through faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. The benefits of the free Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of pitie and clemencie, are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes and condonation of tranſgreſſion; the donation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, everlaſting and continuall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Chriſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of felicitie; perſeverance in the ſtate of grace, by the all-ſufficient hand
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97216:19"/>of God, our clementious and heavenly Father. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: For they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquitie, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> 1. Joh. 3 24. <hi>And he that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> 1. Pet. 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, to be revealed in the last time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. The intrinſicall ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace and ſalvation, is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of glory and obſignation; the extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall, is the Lords Supper, &amp; Baptiſme. 1. <hi>John.</hi> 5.8. <hi>And there are three that bear witneſſe in earth; the Spirit, and the water, and blood: and theſe three agree in one.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break is it not the communion of the bodie of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Whoſoever are under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, are not under the Law,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97216:20"/>but under grace; not under the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the devill, but under the rule and command of Chriſt; not under the dominion of ſin and tranſgreſſion, but under the Regiment of the Spirit of life and adoption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death.</hi> Rom. 8.14. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. The faithfull after the time they are aſſured that God is their God through the Covenant of free grace and mercie; are wholly removed from the barre of juſtice, to heare what ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace, mercy, and ſalvation, ſhall come from the throne of grace and mercie. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The Covenant of grace is ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the faithfull in Chriſt the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolute Mediatour, before they come to the true and effectual aſſurance thereof in their hearts and conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. The joy of the holy Ghoſt doth then fill the hearts of the faithfull, when in the receiving the ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they through the act of faith, do firmly and ſtrongly behold the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97216:20"/>and exceeding freeneſſe of that, to them undeſerving. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14, 15. the 14. <hi>And the grace of our Lord was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundant with faith, and love, which is in Christ Jeſus.</hi> 15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. If any man would have aſſured confidence that he ſhall live immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that grace communicated to him ſhall never be removed, or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; let him turn his eye upon the freeneſſe and newneſſe of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, eſtabliſhed and confirmed to him in the hand of a Mediatour. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. The Morall Law is no part of the new Covenant, in equalitie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is the ſame which was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>And the law is not of faith; but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. As the Father of admirable love and kindneſſe makes his covenant with his in Chriſt; ſo doth every Chriſtian make his covenant with God in Chriſt, ſith that in himſelf there is nothing but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97216:21"/>indigencie, want, and deficiencie; and that through Chriſt the fountaine and well-ſpring of fulneſſe and excellencie, he may receive ſufficient to performe what he hath promiſed to God-ward for his own particular. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches; he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. Our covenant is an holy reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoule and body, to ſerve, obey, feare and love God, our deare and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, in anſwer to that free Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he hath made to us in Chriſt, when he choſe us to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people zealous of good works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelfe for us, that he might redeeme us from all iniquitie, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>THe eye that ſeeth, the eare that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, the mind that conceiveth the immenſe and incomprence love of God to his, may admire that God through grace ſhould make a new covenant of grace to his people, undeſerving grace; he ſaw them in their blood, defiled, ſtained, ſpotted, and impure; yet he choſe, and did not refuſe them in that wofull ſtate and condition. Though they were unfaithfull to God in the firſt covenant, he is faithfull to them in the ſecond: through the breach of the firſt they loſt all; through the help of Chriſt in the ſecond they recover all, in that they ſtood not in the firſt, they ſhut the gates of heaven upon themſelves; through, or by vertue of the ſecond, heaven is open for them to have free entrance: though the Law of works ſpeak bitter, heavy, and terrible things to the conſcience, yet the ſecond ſpeaks not of bitterneſſe, dreadfulneſſe, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſſe; but of favour, bountie, and benignitie to the ſoule or ſpirit. The firſt was in the hand of man, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97216:22"/>in the hand of Chriſt. Hence it is ſo faſt ſtrong, and permanent, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heights, nor depths, principalities, nor powers, neither dominions, nor the prince of darkneſſe with all his rabble, can anihilate, diſanull, or bring to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. O Chriſtian, whileſt thou art comprehended, behold that which is incomprehenſible; whileſt thou art meaſured, behold that which is immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable; whileſt thou pondereſt of ſomething, ponder of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God; how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. VNion is the work of the Spirit of Chriſt through faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saints are united unto Chriſt, and to the Father in Chriſt, to the end they may enjoy communion in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97216:22"/>promiſes and benefits of Chriſt in the ſtate of grace, and in the eſtate of glory, everlaſting beatitude and perfection. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>But he that is joyned unto the Lord, is one ſpirit.</hi> 1. Cor. 3.22. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The faithfull are not onely united to Chriſt, by faith as the inſtrumentall cauſe, by the Spirit, the cauſe <hi>principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter operans;</hi> but alſo by the blood of Chriſt as the cauſe materiall. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It hath not onely been the divine pleaſure or benevolence of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, that we ſhould be united to his dearly beloved Son by nature, but that we ſhould be united to him by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and myſticall union. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one: and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Son of God took upon him the humane nature of mankind, through
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97216:23"/>which he is joyned to all men; but that is infirme, and weake, and not able to bring us to eternall glory without the union myſticall. <hi>I in them, and they in me, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 17.24. <hi>Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This union is produced through effectuall vocation, through which the Saints are brought from the worlds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation to love the Lord Chriſt, with a deare, entire, and tender affection. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithfull, by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of his Sonne Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi> Cant. 1.2. <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth; for thy love is better then wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. By how much the Saints feele the ſence of Gods deare and ſweet bountie, and injoy ſweet communion with their Lord that bought them; by ſo much the more they rejoyce in the love and fellowſhip one of another. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in the light, we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Christ his Sonne cleanſeth us from all ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">

There is ſo ſtrong an union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his Saints, that there is no need of his corporall preſence in this vaile of miſerie; ſith more excellent benefits redounds to the Saints by his preſence in heaven, then if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine on earth. Hence he is ſaid to have conſummated the work of our redemption, to ſit at the right hand of God, to make interceſſion for us, and to go to his Father to provide for us an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.3. <hi>And if I go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto my ſelf; that Where I am, there ye might be alſo.</hi>

It is a myſtery of myſteries, a depth of depths, and a riddle paſt finding out. If I had the tongue of a thouſand Angells, the rationality of a thouſand men, yet could
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97216:25"/>I not relate the excellency of this union betwixt Chriſt and the ſoule, and the ſoule and Chriſt; Rare is the influence of celeſtiall bodies in ſublunary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Rare is the vitall motion in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures; but more is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in them, who are his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and united people. O my ſoule, when thou waſt as far from Chriſt, as heaven is from hell, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, the North from the South, thy Lord came by his oyntments pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, by his drops of liquid myrrhe, by his precious &amp; incomparable bloud, and made thee one with him, who was ſo diſtant from him; thou waſt a dead branch, fit for the everlaſting burnings; thou waſt a dead member, fit for hells interring; thou waſt a divorced Spouſe, not worthy of enjoying; yet his eye of love was deare over thee, and thy Lord hath made thee, a branch, not of hell, but of the Vine of Conſolation; a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not of death, but of himſelfe the head of his Church, and ſweet dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Spouſe, not of an earthly Prince, and Monarch, but to himſelfe the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his Fathers delectation: Oh! what love is this, that my Lord ſhould goe to

                  <p n="1">1. VOcation is a gathering of men unto Chriſt, by the Goſpell of life and everlaſting ſalvation, that they may be united unto him, by a happie and perpetuall union. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithfull, by whom we are called unto the Communion of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Vocation, is efficatious, or ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97216:27"/> 3. Efficatious vocation is that through which the faithfull are called from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Kingdome, to the Kingdome of grace and glory, by the ſanctifying Word of truth, and the effectuall work of the Spirit, that they may not want in the appointed time, that glorious ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which Chriſt their Lord hath purchaſed. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>That thou mayeſt open the eyes of the blind, and convert them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive the remiſſion of ſinnes, and an inheritance amongst them who are ſanctified by faith, which is in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Inefficatious vocation, is when the ſonnes of men are under the ſentence of the Goſpel of atonement and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, yet never find the effectuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the holy Spirit, unto an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Converſion; <hi>Hence many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and few are choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Vocation is Univerſall or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Vocation univerſall, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God invites all men, through the miniſtery of peace and propitiation, that they would come to the knowledg of himſelfe, and Jeſus Chriſt, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97216:27"/>Redeemer of his elect and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>For which cauſe I Paul am made Miniſter, to preach the Goſpel to every creature under heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Speciall vocation is that whereby God doth dignifie his owne peculiar, whileſt he doth illuminate their minds, working in their hearts effectually by his Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5 <hi>Moreover, hope makes not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Univerſall Vocation, hath been ſhadowed out by Types, or divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. By Types, <hi>Melcheſidecke,</hi> although he was a Gentile, and without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nevertheles, he was the Prieſt of the moſt high GOD, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.1.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. By Oracles, he ſhall be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Gentiles; <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.21. <hi>And in his Name ſhall the Gentiles trust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. In vocation, there is Chriſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the Chriſtians reception conſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Chriſts offer is, that he will be a ſufficient Redemption, Reconciliation, and Salvation to every one who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97216:28"/>and reſteth on him, as his aſſured refuge and eternall Sanctury. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall drinke of the water which I ſhall give unto him, ſhall not thirſt againe: but the water which I ſhall give unto him, ſhall be in him a fountaine of ſpringing water unto eternall life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Chriſts proffer is internall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Chriſts externall proffer is, when by the Miniſters of the Word of truth, and ſalvation, he propoſeth himſelfe the onely and abſolute ſalvation in heaven and earth. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other, neither is there any other name given under heaven, by which we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Chriſts internall proffer is, when Chriſt propoſeth himſelfe effectually to the hearts of the faithfull, through which they have aſſured confidence, that Chriſt hath redeemed and ſaved them from ſinne, Satan, the Law, hell, and deſtruction, and that the Lord Chriſt will communicate to them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, peace, joy, and everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. <hi>That their hearts might be comforted, and they knit together in love, and in all riches of the full aſſurance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97216:28"/>of underſtanding, to know the mystery of God, even the Father, and of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Reception is through which the faithfull doe not refuſe the proffer of grace, but receiveth it through the help of the Spirit of glory. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43, 44. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his Name whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes. While Peter ſpake theſe words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17 Sometimes there is a reception of the Word of mercy and propitiation, which is not operative, or effectuall to ſalvation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>And he that receiveth ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with joy receiveth it. Yet hath not roote in himſelfe, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or perſecution ariſeth, becauſe of the word; by and by he is offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Reception is either taken active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or paſſively.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Actively, when the heart reſteth on Chriſt the bleſſed Redeemer of his; redeemed &amp; reconciled, paſſively when there is a ſpirituall being of grace in the hearts of actuall Beleevers. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97216:29"/>of the Word, that yee may grow thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Sometimes the Saints are called alone by the efficacy of the Spirit of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation: Sometimes by the Word, and efficacy of the Word of Life and Redemption. The Word and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are not ſeperated in the vocation of the Saints. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo yee have truſted after that yee heard the Word of truth, even the Goſpel of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wherein alſo after yee beleeved, yee were ſealed with the holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. All the faithfull have been effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called from eternall, by vertue of Gods decree, notwithſtanding the Declaration thereof, is, as it may make for their good, and the glory of God their heavenly and gracious Father. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>In him, I ſay, in whom yee have obtained an inheritance, being prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things, after the councell of his owne will. That we may be to the praiſe of his glory, who firſt truſted in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. God calls not all his Elect and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted in the ſame moment, to the knowledge of his ſanctifying truth,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97216:29"/>and the ſence of free and benignous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and experience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. This hath not been without the divine pleaſure of our gracious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, that Election which hath been before the world was, he maketh knowne to his by operative and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Vocation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them alſo hath he called, and whom he hath called, them alſo hath he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and whom he hath justified, them alſo hath he glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Election and Vocation proceeds from the free benevolence of a loving God, and are confirmed to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of true beleevers, through the true and faithfull teſtimony of the Spirit of Adoption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>And the Spirit witneſſeth together with our ſpirit, that wee are the Sonnes of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. If we deſire to ſee and know the propitious minde of God, let us turne our faces towards Chriſt, in whom the Father is well pleaſed, if we would ſeeke eternall life, and the immortalitie of the celeſtiall Kingdome. Not to any other but to Chriſt muſt we flie, for he is the fountaine of our life, the Author of our ſalvation, and the ground of our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97216:30"/>and effectuall calling. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but to ſalvation by the meanes of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our worke, but according to his owne purpoſe and grace, which was given to us through Jeſus Chriſt before the world was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. Now whitherward doth our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection tend? but that through the bountie of him, who is propitious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, we may enjoy the filiation of ſonnes, immortalitie and ſalvation; and although our minds are troubled, and our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences perplexed, yet no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can we know the certaintie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but by vocation, and abſolute rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for abſolute regeneration and vocation, are aſſured pledges of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, immortalitie, and filiation. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3 4. <hi>Bleſſed be God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant bountie, hath begetten us to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead. To an inheritance immortall, and undefiled, and that withereth not, reſerved in heaven for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Although our heavenly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97216:30"/>Father, love all his people, as he loved his beloved Chriſt; yet it is his divine grace and pleaſure, in effectuall vocation, to try ſome of his in the fiery furnace of ſorrowes, and great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Who when they heard it, they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid to Peter, and other Apoſtles, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, What ſhall we doe?</hi> Iſa. 6.5. <hi>Then ſaid I, I am a man undone, I am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell amongst a people of polluted lips; mine eyes have ſeene the King the Lord of Hoasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. Our life is hid with God in Chriſt, and we are called efficaciouſly from the world, unto celeſtiall grace, and from woefull darkneſſe, unto his glorious light, that we may live godly in this preſent world, expecting the comming of our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I therefore being priſoner in the Lord, pray you that yee walke worthy of the vocation whereunto yee are called.</hi> Titus 2.13. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that bleſſed hope, and that glorious comming of that great God, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97216:31"/>of our heart. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 3. <hi>In that yee are manifest, to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by us, and written, not with inke, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, but in the fleſhly Tables of the heart:</hi> The one accuſeth us before the Barre of Juſtice, the other acquitteth us before the Mercy Seate. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to accuſe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father, there is one who accuſeth you, to wit, Moſes, in whom yee truſt.</hi> Hath <hi>Moſes</hi> fetcht home the loſt ſheep? ſought the loſt groat; or imbraced the poore, returned Prodigalls; No; it was our Chriſt, the great and bleſſed Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Iſrael. What are the drops or dewes, without the Sunne? or what can the body effect without the ſoule? or what can the Law doe in the act of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, without the effectuall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of Jeſus: from whence art thou called, O my ſoule? Not onely from the receipt of cuſtome, but from the cuſtome of hell; Not onely from prophaneneſſe to civilitie, from civilitie to moralitie; but from all to heavenly and celeſtiall grace and glory; What haſt thou found in Chriſt, fince he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee? I have found my life in him.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97216:32"/>my name in the heavenly places; a hope amongſt his peculiar; a reſt in his love; a communion in his promiſes; a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip amongſt the Saints; and the glorious, gracious, and loving face of a ſweet Father. And haſt thou not alſo found rare effects in thee ſince the time of his overpowring of his precious gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yea now his love is more to me then Kingdomes, then Conſullſhips, then riches, then honours, then dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then Dominions; yea then all things. If I were poſſeſt with the wealth of <hi>Arabia;</hi> the riches of <hi>India;</hi> the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Africa;</hi> and the glory of <hi>Europe;</hi> what would thoſe be to me without a Chriſt? I would rather chooſe one dram of his grace, then mountaines of gold, then a ſea of ſilver, then an earth of pleaſures, and Kingdomes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of delights, and delectations. <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me children, or els I dye;</hi> I ſay, give me Chriſt, or I ſhall dye. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>What availes all theſe, if I goe childleſſe?</hi> I ſay, what availeth all, if I goe Chriſtleſſe? Was <hi>Jacob</hi> comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he wanted <hi>Joſeph?</hi> or can I be comforted, when I want my Beloved? And did not <hi>Rachel</hi> mourne, and would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97216:32"/>not be comforted when her children were not? And doe I not mourne, and cannot be comforted, becauſe my Chriſt is not? From henceforth will I triumph, with the triumphers, and take my place amongſt the Conquerours; for I am not called from the ſheepfold, but from the gates of hell, and made a King and Prieſt to God the Father; I am not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dungeon, but from the dungeon of darkneſſe to be a ſonne of God the Father, and a brother to the Prince of grace and glory; therefore I ſhall ſee my Fathers face, and behold his glory. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. <hi>And they ſhall ſee his face, and his Name ſhall be in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi> Verſe the fift; <hi>And they ſhall reigne for evermore.</hi>

                  <p>ADoption is the gracious ſentence of God, through which he doth accept of the faithfull for ſonnes and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97216:33"/>daughters in Jeſus Chriſt. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſonnes of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Adoption there is a gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the good will and pleaſure of God, that he would adopt us in Chriſt for his peculiar, who by ſin were the children of wrath and of the devill, and were by nature the children of wrath as well as other. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>But God who is rich in mercie, for his great love wherewith he loved us.</hi> Epheſ. 1.5. <hi>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Adoption proceeds from Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it is collocated in Chriſt, and ſealed to the Saints through the Spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 15. <hi>For ye have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of bondage again to fear: but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Adoption is not onely for Chriſts ſake, who hath merited the ſame for us; but it flows alſo from Gods benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and bountie towards his elect and choſen. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6. <hi>And becauſe ye are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97216:33"/>ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts, crying, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The faithfull do not onely look for eternall life through the title they have by redemption; but alſo through the title they have by adoption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>And not onely they but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit; even we our ſelves groane within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſweetneſſe and conſolation of the faithfull ariſeth when inſtead of the ſons of the devill they through faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend themſelves to be the ſonnes of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that beleeve on his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 As the Lord Chriſt in juſtification is applyed as a garment to cover ſinnes; ſo in Adoption he is applyed as the Prince of our life and ſalvation. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.10. <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſons unto glory, to make the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their ſalvation perfect through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:97216:34"/> 8. This conjunction is ſo ſtrong, that although Chriſt is properly the Son of God by nature; hence tearmed the firſt begotten of God, notwithſtanding by this grace of adoption and communion with God in Chriſt, all the faithfull are called the ſonnes of God. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>And I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſonnes and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almightie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Although <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſonne of God by creation, yet not by the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conjunction and union with Chriſt as we are by adoption. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. The dignitie which we have through adoption doth not onely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound that common relation which every creature hath to Godward, but alſo that which <hi>Adam</hi> poſſeſt before he relinquiſht his puritie and integritie.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. God hath taken the adopted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of his own flock or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and given to them his name, and hath undertaken to be their eternall protector in the time of danger. <hi>Revel.</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:97216:34"/>3.12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out; and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is the new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new Name.</hi> Iſa. 4.4 5. the 4. <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughters of Sion, and ſhall have purged the blood of Jeruſalem from the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the ſpirit of judgement, and by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of burning.</hi> The 5. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Sion, and upon her aſſemblies, a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glorie ſhall be a defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. The inheritance to which the faithfull are adopted is eternall life, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious communion, and everlaſting bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh; that he ſhould give eternall life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. That bleſſedneſſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Saints redeemed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, is not communicated to them for their merits or deſervings, but through
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97216:35"/>free grace, through which they have obtained the dignitie of ſons, through adoption or filiation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.3.5. <hi>Neither let the ſonne of the ſtranger that hath joyned himſelf to the Lord ſpeake, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Lord hath utterly ſeparated me from his people; neither let the Eunuch ſay, Behold, I am a drie tree.</hi> The 5. <hi>Even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them will I give in mine houſe, and within my walls, a place, and a name better then of ſonnes and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name that ſhall not be cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Divine Adoption is not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſucceſſion, but to the participation of an inheritance aſſigned. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The eyes of your underſtanding being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling; and what the riches of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his inheritance in the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. The proper adjunct of adoption is the teſtification of the holy Spirit which is given to the faithfull. Hence they are ſaid to be ſealed by the Spirit. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Now he which ſtabliſheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us is God.</hi> The 22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earnest of his Spirit in our hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. God hath adopted his elect unto
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97216:35"/>himſelf; not that he had no other Son, for Chriſt was tearmed his beloved and onely begotten Sonne: but amongſt the ſons of men he had no other, untill they were adopted to be beloved in Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 26. <hi>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Through the Spirit of Chriſt we have faith, through which we lay hold on the death of Chriſt Mediatour; and the promiſe of God our benevolous and gracious Father, by which we are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be ſons and daughters. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.26. <hi>vide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. By <hi>Adam</hi> we were alienated from God, wherefore God hath ſent his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten and beloved Sonne, that through him he might chuſe many ſons out of humane generation. Hence we are ſaid to be choſen out of the world, through his divine love and free benevolence. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Ye have not choſen me but I have choſen you, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: that whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the Father in my Name, he may give it you.</hi> Joh. 17.14. <hi>I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them; becauſe they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97216:36"/>are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. The royall robe of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is their covering in the day of judgement; the blood of Chriſt is their peace in the day of evill; and the name of God is their glory in the midſt of afflictions. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Yea in the way of thy judgements, O Lord, have we waited for thee: the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. The adopted are made kings and prieſts to God the Father, through the blood of the Sonne of God Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5, 6. the 5. <hi>And from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ who is the faithfull witneſſe, and the firſt begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth: unto him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> Verſe the 6. <hi>And hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father. To him be glory and deminion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. The ſonnes of God by adoption may feele the ſence of Gods anger; yet God is not angry with them, but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding loving, bountifull, and full of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie towards them. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97216:36"/>iniquitie, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage? He retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in mercy.</hi> Malachi 3.17. <hi>And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, in that day when I make up my jewels: and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſonne that ſerveth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Though the Father of deare love do crown his deare people with deare love, grace, and mercie, yet he doth not alwayes endow them with outward bleſſings and proſperitie. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. the 4. <hi>But in all things approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes.</hi> The 5. <hi>In ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labours, in watching, in faſtings:</hi> the 6. <hi>By pureneſſe, by knowledge, by long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by kindneſſe, by the holy Ghoſt, by love unfained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. The cries, groanes, and ſighs of the ſonnes of God, whether in the day they want the ſence of Gods dear love and rareſt bountie towards them, or in the time of great and ſtrong temptation over tops the roarings of Satan, the cries of vengeance, and the arraigning ſentence of the Law ſo terrible. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97216:37"/>
                     <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought. But the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Though the ſonnes of God may looſe the ſence of their firſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet they ſhall for ever injoy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and perpetuall union, ſo that God for evermore ſtands in relation unto them as a Father; and they to him as loving and dear children. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Iſrael ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth us not: O Lord, thou art our Father, our redeemer; thy name is from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</hi> Iſa. 64.9. <hi>Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord, neither remember iniquitie for ever; behold, ſee us we beſeech thee, we beſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. Though we were the ſonnes of God by creation, yet we became through ſin the ſonnes of the devill, of wrath, of incredulitie, of diffidence, of this world, and of darkneſſe; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by adoption we are made ſons, partakers of the divine nature, brethren of Chriſt, and children of light; that we might not ſin, but that we might be one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97216:37"/>with Chriſt through union; and that we might love the brethren with entire love and affection. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature, having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the corruption that is in the world through luſt.</hi> Hebr. 2.11. <hi>For both he who ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all one: For which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.</hi> Joh. 15.12. <hi>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. The kingdom of our God, the glory of which is unutterable, unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unmentionable; hath been prepared of old for thoſe who have a being in Chriſt; intereſt in the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and have been beloved of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the world was. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi>

                  <p>OH the deepneſſe of immenſe and admirable love, that of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97216:38"/>children of diffidence and diſtruction, through Chriſt are made Saints and ſonnes of ſalvation; that of veſſels of wrath, hell, the devill, and damnation, we are made the veſſels of rich mercie, peace, love, and happic conſolation. When I was a poore diſtreſſed captive taken by the devill, did I think to be made an heire with Chriſt, and freed from the accuſing law, and wofull evill? not thy wiſdom, but the wiſdom of thy deare &amp; benignous Father, hath found a way in the time of miſery, to bring thee to glorious and bleſſed felicitie. That was not found in the land of the living. Ask the depths, and they will ſay that wiſdom was not found there? Ask the Sea, and it will ſay; it had no habitation there; in thy deare Father hath been the place of ſingular wiſdom and rareſt intelligence. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> knew his dreame, but was ignorant of the interpretation; thou knoweſt thou waſt a ſlave, but waſt ignorant of thy redemption and adoption. O admirable priviledge, and excellent prerogative! O wonderfull dignitie given to the Saints, by filiation! What is it to be the ſon of a King? or an Emperour? of a Monarch? of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97216:38"/>What is it to be an heire to Kingdoms, to Provinces, or to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires? What is it to enjoy pleaſures, joy, or delectations in this orbe terreſtriall, if we enjoy not the priviledge of the daughters, and the ſons of the living God? It cannot avail thee to be an heir, and not an heire of Chriſts kingdome. It cannot advantage thee to be a ſon of an Emperour, and not to be the ſon of God by adoption; it cannot help thee to be nephew to a Potentate, and not to be an inheritour with the Lords inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Thou art Gods by creation, but art thou Gods by a ſpeciall relation? Thou haſt treaſures abundant, but art thou his chief treaſure? thou haſt inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance amongſt the ſons of men, but haſt thou an inheritance amongſt the ſons of royall poſſeſſion? O my ſoule! what will thy ſweet Father do for thee? great things, he will give thee a name better then of the ſons and daughters; He will protect thee by an invincible protection, and crowne thee with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and glorious ſalvation.

CHiefly our knowledge conſiſts in this, that having loſt what was given in the creation is again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us by the hand of Chriſt in the act of Redemption, who ſhed his blood to redeeme us from evils. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Yea doubtleſſe I count all things but loſſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97216:39"/>for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things: and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The knowledge of Chriſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is known by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and by the materiall cauſe of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Redemption is the bringing of man to the ſtate of libertie from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſin and Satan by the exhibition of a inſt price. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Even as the Sonne of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The end of Redemption is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the faſt meaſure, rule, and reaſon of application, is the fame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will of God which hath been the cauſe of mans Redemption. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Christ, nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Man being loſt, he muſt ſeek for the Redemption of his ſoule through the hand of Chriſt: Chriſt is the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the elect, the conſervation of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97216:40"/>the Church, the inſtauration after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, and the redemption of his from Satan, ſin, and all miſeries. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeeme us from all iniquitie; and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We receive the vertue of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt through the power of the Spirit of Chriſt, who joyneth us with Chriſt. Hence is he called the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſanctification and adoption, and the ſeal of our redemption and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earnest of his Spirit in our hearts.</hi> Epheſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. When as in the loyns of <hi>Adam</hi> whole humane kind was loſe, ſo that the nobleneſſe and excellencie of our eſtate of integritie cannot profit us when we think upon it; but rather turn to our greater ſhame, untill God the Father appear in the perſon of his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son to the ſaving or freeing of our ſouls from all calamities. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Christ Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:97216:40"/> 8. After the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> whole mankind was inthralled, his knowledge of God unto ſalvation ſure would profit him nothing without a Saviour. Hence ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Christ whom thou hast ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Whileſt we are condemned by the Law, dead in ſin; naked, wanting righteouſneſſe; poore, wanting riches; and bondmen, wanting libertie: we muſt ſeek for theſe at the hands of our Redeemer, in whom, and at whoſe hands we may receive theſe in the time of neceſſitie. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. <hi>Seeing then that we have a great high Priest that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the Sonne of God, let us hold fast our profeſſion. For we have not an high Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all points tempted like us, yet without ſinne, Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy; and find grace to help in time of need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Not raſhly, nor by hap, or chance, or by the will of man, that Chriſt ſhould have this name <hi>(Jeſus)</hi> but from the wil
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97216:41"/>of God, delivered by the Angels; that he ſhould ſave his people from their ſinnes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>And ſhee ſhall bring forth a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus; for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. God was an enemy to man, till by the death of Chriſt, he was reſtored in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour. Man was accurſed, till by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, his iniquitie was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated: he was ſeparated, untill by the body of Chriſt, he into Conjunction hath been received, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Croſſe, having ſlaine the enemy thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. God loves us firſt, after by Chriſt he redeemeth us unto himſelfe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Chriſt by death redeem us from him that hath the power of death, iniquitie doth remaine, which may deſerve the indignation of God; ſo that through it we may ſtand accurſed, and condemned in his ſight. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Now wee know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law: that every mouth may be ſtopped, &amp; all the world may become guiltie before God.</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5. Verſe the 4. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97216:41"/>time was come, God ſent forth his ſonne, made of a woman, made under the Law.</hi> Verſe the 5. <hi>To redeeme them that were under the Law, that wee might receive the Adoption of ſonnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. When as we are redeemed by the death of Chriſt, it is not ſo underſtood, as though now he ſhould begin to love us, whom before he hated: but that now loving us, he doth redeeme us to be his people. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Who gave himſelfe for our ſinnes, that he may deliver us from this preſent evill world, according to the will of God and our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. It was not ſufficient for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, that Chriſt ſhould undergoe death, but alſo that he might feele the ſence of his Fathers wrath upon him for us, that ſo our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from wrath might be fully accompliſhed. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree, that we being dead to ſinne, ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe, by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Father hath aboliſhed the power of ſinne, when the curſe of God reſted on the fleſh of Chriſt, then Chriſt was a ſatisfactory ſacrifice to his Father
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97216:42"/>for ſinne, that the ſtrife being ended, through his ſacrifice, we may ceaſe to feare the anger of God any more. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15 Verſe the 14. <hi>For as much then as the Children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame, that through death, he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Deuill.</hi> Verſe the 15. <hi>And deliver them, who through feare of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. God hath commended his love to us, who gave Chriſt the price of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us; commanding us to flee for ſuccour to his bloud, that through that we might ſtand ſecure in the day of Judgement. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God hath commended his love toward us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Chriſt hath been ſubject to the righteouſneſſe of God, that he might performe what was required of us, fully performing what was neceſſary, to the delivery of thoſe who are true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>For Christ is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe, to every one that beleeveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. The great grace and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97216:42"/>of God, is manifeſted in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his from evill, to enjoy the chiefeſt good. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23. <hi>Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred us in our low eſtate; for his mercy eadureth for ever.</hi> Verſe the 24. <hi>And hath delivered us from our enemies; for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. The application of delivery, is the ſingular worke of the Spirit of life and Adoption. <hi>Hence the Spirit is ſaid to be the earneſt of the Saints Redemption, and the ſeale of their everlaſting delivery and liberation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20 Redemption floweth from the divine Decree and Donation of GOD, whereby he doth give certaine men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, that he might redeeme and ſave them from ſinne and iniquitie. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.68, 69. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael; for he hath viſited and redeemed his people. And hath raiſed up an horne of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21 Redemption is not without the minde of Chriſt, being Chriſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that his ſatisfaction ſhould be for the good of them whom he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme by his bloud unto God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97216:43"/>Thou art worthy to take the booke, and to open the ſeales thereof; for thou waſt ſlaine and hast redeemed us to God, by thy bloud, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. The ſhedding of the bloud of Chriſt, is not without the acceptation of his Father; being his Father accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his ſatisfaction through his bloud, as ſufficient to ſalvation, redemption, and reconciliation. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And (having made peace through the bloud of his Croſſe) by him to reconcile all things to himſelfe: by him, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Liberation or Redemption from ſinne, and death, not onely hath been eſtabliſhed in Gods Decree, but alſo in Chriſt, and granted to us, in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be received of us. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>And he is the propitiation for our ſinnes; and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Chriſt did ſatisfie for them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who by him are ſaved; although in reſpect of his ſufficiency, he hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all, and every one. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who gave himſelfe a ranſome for all, to be a teſtimonie in due time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:97216:43"/> 25. The death of Chriſt frees from ſinne; the bloud of Chriſt from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, and iniquitie: The power of Chriſt from the jawes of Satan; and Chriſts active and paſſive obedience from the force of the morall Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; For it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. Through the delivery or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from theſe, we have not onely aſſurance, that wee ſhall inherit the Kingdome of glory; but alſo in the ſtate of grace we have aſſurance, that wee ſhall continually have ſupplyes, of that abundant and overflowing grace, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his fulnes, have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Peace of Conſcience, joy in the holy Ghoſt, holineſſe of converſation, are adjuncts of this freedome, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. <hi>That he would grant unto us, that we being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without feare.</hi> 75. <hi>In holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97216:44"/> 28. Redemption hath been once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, twice manifeſted in the day of grace, and the houre of Judgement. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>And not onely they but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, even we our ſelves, groane-within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. Redemption doth ſo farre free the Chriſtian, that he is wholly taken from the barre of Juſtice, and placed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at the throne of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18.22, 23, 24. Verſe the 18. <hi>For yee are not come unto the Mount, that might be touched, and that burneth with fire, nor unto blackneſſe and darkeneſſe and tempest.</hi> Verſe the 22. <hi>But yee are come unto Mount Sien, and unto the Citie of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of Angells.</hi> Verſe the 23. <hi>To the generall Aſſembly, and the Church of the firſt borne, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Verſe the 24. <hi>And to Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Covenant, and to the bloud of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. The comfort and conſolation of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97216:44"/>the Redemption by the hand of Chriſt Redeemer, is according to the act of faith in Chriſt, by whom this redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wrought. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.8. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoule from death: mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling.</hi> Iſaiah 51.11. <hi>Therefore the Redeemed of the Lord ſhall returne; and come with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Sion; and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their head; they ſhall obtaine gladnes, and joy, and ſorrow ſhall flee away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. There is an inſeparable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Election and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſith that before the foundation of the world, Chriſt was choſen to be the Redeemer of his choſen and peculiar. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Having made knowne unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he had purpoſed in himſelfe.</hi> Verſe the 7. <hi>In whom we have reaemption through his bloud, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, according to the riches of his grace.</hi>

                  <head>Contemplation.</head>
                  <p>SUch was the kindneſſe of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that once in fiftie yeare, they had a yeare of Jubile; in which he who was in bondage, and thraldome, was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97216:45"/>ſet at libertie, and freedome: Such hath been the bountie of God to us, that he hath appointed a yeare of deliverance, by the hand of Chriſt, that we being Captives might be ſet free, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bondſlaves, we might be ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Chriſt was anointed for that end, not with the oyle of Olives, or other materiall ſubſtance, but with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and overflowing grace of God, that hee might bring poore Captives from Captivitie, and wee who were poore bondmen, from everlaſting ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. What is the bondage to man, in reſpect of the bondage to Satan? or what is the libertie amongſt men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the libertie of Chriſt Jeſus? From what are we freed? yea from what are we not freed? from the dominion of ſinne, the ſlavery of the Law, the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Satan, and the gates of the pit of hell and deſtruction. By what art thou freed? yea by what art thou not freed? From ſinne by the precious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable, ineſtimable bloud of Chriſt, out of the jawes of Satan: by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, invincible, and unconquerable ſtrength of Chriſt, from the force of death: by the vertuall, and efficatious
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97216:45"/>death of Chriſt, and from the curſing, condemning, and arraigning power of the Morall Law, by the full and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory obedience of Chriſt. It hath not been in the power of man, nor the will of man to worke out the work of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or the worke of Redemption; the Wine-preſſe of Gods wrath, would have been too hotte, and too heavie for him: It hath not been in the minde of Angells, it would have cruſht them to the earth, yea to hell, to have born that weightie wrath, and fierce indignation of God againſt ſinne, when neither ſpeare nor ſhield was found among a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the world, for the delivery of mankinde; ſtrength and power hath been found in the armes of Chriſt, fully to performe the worke of deliverance: if a world had been given for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of one ſoule, it would have been refuſed; an infinite would admit of nothing finite. O! what worth? what value? what price is the bloud of Chriſt, which is of ſufficiency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme all men? all the power of the Creature, could not bring one ſoule out of the ſlavery of the Devill. Oh! what power? what ſtrength? what worth of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97216:46"/>excellency is there in Chriſt? who by his power, ſtrength, and might, hath brought thouſands out of the bondage and ſlavery of hell, and the Devill? All the Angells in heaven could not by their skill remove one poore ſoule from the barre of Juſtice, and bring it to the mercy-ſeate, to heare one word of mercy. What a Sea of wiſdome is in Chriſt? who by his wiſdome can bring all the poore and diſtreſſed Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the throne of mercies, to receive whole Rivers of mercy from thence unto their ſoules. <hi>Sampſon</hi> overthrew more at his death, then he did all his life: Chriſt did more in the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his in death, then he did in the time of his life. Let us therefore lift up our eyes to heaven, and behold the bountifull and benignous mind of God unto us, that whileſt our caſes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperable, and we ſaw no way for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, God hath found out a way, and hath ſent from heaven the Sonne of his love, to be our deliverer. A Ram was not provided, but a Lamb, that through his bloud tooke away the ſinnes of the world, ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for his people, a joyfull and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97216:46"/>freedome. God manifeſted his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the Cloud, and overthrew <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> his Charets, and horſemen in the red Sea. God manifeſted his mightie ſtrength in the ſubverting of Satan and ſinne, through the bloud of Chriſt. When <hi>Peter</hi> was in bonds, the Angell ſet <hi>Peter</hi> free; when we were bound by chaines, in the dungeon of darkneſſe and death, Chriſt hath ſet us free; So that now the conſciences and ſpirits of the faithfull, and ours alſo, are free to grace, and to the enjoyment of the Kingdome of felicitie; let the Chriſtian therefore thinke on theſe things, and triumph with the Apoſtle; <hi>Oh death, where is thy ſting; oh hell, where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;</hi> let him not feare, neither Law, nor hell, nor death, nor the Devill, ſith he is redeemed from the world, though he live in the world, to God above, who is all in all; to whom be aſcribed the praiſe of all for evermore. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Now unto the King eternall, immortall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and the onely wiſe God, be honour and glory, for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. It is convenient that Chriſt who is the Mediatour betwixt God and man, ſhould be God-man; unleſſe he had been
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97216:47"/>man, he had not been a fit ſacrifice: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had been God, he had not been of ſufficient vertue. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Through the perſonall union of both natures, Chriſt Mediatour is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come King of his Church, and head of the ſame kind with his body. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, Which is his body, the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The humiliation of Chriſt through which he ſubmitted himſelf to anſwer the righteouſneſſe of God, and his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which was manifeſted when he roſe again from the dead, aſcending on high, leading captivitie captive, hath obtained a perfect redemption for the faithfull. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> Hebr 9.12. <hi>Neither by the blood of goats, and calves, but by his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſatisfaction and merit of Chriſt Mediatour, hath taken away
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97216:48"/>condemnation, and hath brought eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life and ſalvation. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hath tranſlated us into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his dear Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The merit and ſatisfaction of Chriſt differ in divers operations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The exaltation of Chriſt is no part of the merits or ſatisfaction of Chriſt, through which he mediates for his with his Father. <hi>The ground is this, ſith the exaltation of Chriſt Mediatour, followeth his croſſe or ſatisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Chriſt is ſaid to be Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the faithfull, not that it wholly agreeth to the humaine nature of Chriſt, but alſo to his divine nature. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the holy Ghost hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The ſatisfaction of Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſubſtance of it preſuppoſeth grace: through grace Chriſt hath been called to the work of ſatisfaction. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to griefe: when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſinne, he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97216:48"/>ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. When we ſpeak of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Chriſt Jeſus, we muſt have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the divine pleaſure of God; for through that he hath ordained Chriſt to be Mediatour, that he might obtain eternall peace for his redeemed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>And we like ſheep have gone aſtray: we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquitie of us all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. The price of our redemption could not be payd by man; therefore it hath been the work of a Mediatour to pay the ranſome, to intercede betwixt God and man; not onely by payment, procuring redemption, but alſo by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, making a perfect peace and reconciliation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. the laſt verſe: <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath powred out his ſoul unto death; and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſours, and he bare the ſinnes of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</hi> Epheſ. 2.14. <hi>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97216:49"/>down the middle wall of partition betweene us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. When as our ſins were as a cloud betwixt God and us, we being baniſhed and ſhut out from his preſence, ſo that we could not behold his favour: neither could we aſcend to him, unleſſe he had deſcended down to us by the hand of a Mediatour. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>And came and preached peace to you which were afarre off, and to them that were nigh. For through him we both have an acceſſe by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Although man had ſtood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire without ſpot or wrinkle, yet was he of ſo meane a condition that he could never come to God without the hand of the Mediatour Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>The ground is this, ſith it would have been a diſhonour to the Lord Christ, if man ſhould have acceſſe to God bleſſed for ever, except by himſelf who was the appointed Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. The miſſion of Chriſt that he might be Mediatour, and that he might be reconciler betwixt God and man, floweth from the divine decree of God, upon which dependeth the beatitude or felicitie of man. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97216:49"/>made known unto us the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure which he had purpoſed in himſelf. That in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the fulneſſe of times he might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth even in him.</hi> Luk. 2.14. <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. In the perſon of Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour there are two things conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the diſtinction of natures, and the perſonal union of both together divine, ſo farre as he is the ſecond perſon of the Trinitie: humaine, ſo farre as he took upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Hebr. 2.14. <hi>Foraſmuch then as the children are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. The interceſſion of Chriſt is twofold; verball, or meritorious. Verball in his prayers for his whom he would redeeme and juſtifie; meritorious being an oblation of infinite value accepted of his Father; that through that, the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, perſons, and ſervices of beleevers may be accepted in all ages. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97216:50"/>
                     <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world; but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> Hebr. 10.5, 6. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world he ſaith, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. In burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. The office of Chriſt Mediatour, is not onely to pray for his, but to offer up his life for the redemption or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the life of his people. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter; and to give his life a ranſome for many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. The interceſſion of Chriſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, is the cauſe of the interceſſion of the Spirit in us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. <hi>And he that ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the ſpirit, becauſe he maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Chriſt Mediatour intercedes for his with his Father: he is ever preſent with his Father. The Father ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth that ſacrifice once offered by him for his peculiar. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7 25. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able alſo to ſave them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97216:50"/>ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. The interceſſion of Chriſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, hath been ſufficient and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious from the beginning, by vertue of the decree, promiſe, and acceptation. <hi>Hence he was tearmed a Lambe ſlain from the beginning of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. The adoption of beleevers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the grace of Chriſt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Chriſt Mediatour was never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed without the ſhedding of his blood; being it hath been the eternall counſell of God that none ſhould be cleanſed from ſin without that blood ſo precious. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation, received by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from your fathers: But with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of Christ, as of a Lambe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh, and without ſpot. Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in theſe last times for you.</hi> Revel. 1.5. <hi>And from Jeſus Christ who is the faithfull witneſſe, and the firſt begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:97216:51"/> 23. The prayers of all the faithfull from the beginning of the world hath had acceptation alone for the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſake Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17.23. <hi>Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy ſervant, and his ſupplications, and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy ſanctuarie that is deſolate for the Lords ſake. At the beginning of thy ſupplications the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee for thou art greatly beloved; therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the matter, and underſtand the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. The anger of God reſts on them who leave Chriſt the onely Mediatour, by the appointment of God the Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that beleeveth on the Sonne; hath everlasting life: and he that beleeveth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. God never ſheweth himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to any without the mediation of Chriſt the abſolute Mediatour. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. And lo a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. The ſacrifices in the time of the Law taught plainly, that God would not be mercifull to any, but through
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97216:51"/>Chriſt; and that ſalvation could not be found elſewhere ſave in the expiation of Chriſt, who ſhould poure out his blood for his peoples ranſome. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Likewiſe alſo he took the Cup after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſaying, this Cup is the new Testament in my blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. When as man hath not been able to ſtand in Gods ſight, through the feare and terrour of tranſgreſſion, that we might appear without fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he hath given Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, that he might be Mediatour and Advocate with himſelf for us. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12. <hi>I write unto you little children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your ſinnes are forgiven you, for his Names ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. Chriſt is Mediatour to day, ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and for ever. Hence Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never fail of acceptation in Gods ſight that loves them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. <hi>He hath made us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. Who of the ſonnes of men could make themſelves the ſons of God; of captives, heires of the celeſtiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? except Chriſt, Mediatour, who aſſumed the humaine nature of man,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97216:52"/>that he might give to them that pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his grace which was given unto him, and that he might take to him that which belonged unto them. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. The prayers which the faithfull offer up to God are freely accepted, through the mediation of Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>And walk in love, as Chriſt alſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and hath given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice unto God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. Chriſt for ever appearing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour and Advocate in the preſence of God; God doth turn away his face from our ſins, and turn his face toward his righteouſnes. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Seve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Citie, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iniquitie, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſſe, and to ſeal up the viſion, and propheſie, and to anoint the moſt holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. Through the mediation of Chriſt, true beleevers have free acceſſe to the throne of grace, from which they are filled with divine grace, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97216:52"/>bleſſings, being freed from the terrors &amp; horrors of their ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. <hi>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, may ſerve him without fear.</hi> Hebr. 2.15. <hi>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. Damned preparatories will faile in the houre of death and judgement, when the mediation of Chriſt will be a citie of refuge againſt ſin, and an arke of covert againſt the rigour of the Law, and all evils. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is riſen again: who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</hi>

                  <head>Contemplation.</head>
                  <p>SUch was thy ſeparation, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, from God, that thou nor I could approach nigh to God without the hand of our Mediatour Chriſt Jeſus; through ſin the hand-writing is written againſt us; we are laid in the ballance and found too light: the mightie wall of ſeparation doth ſo prevent us from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97216:53"/>that unleſſe God did deſcend down to us by Chriſt, we could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to him. If we did but think of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to God without Chriſt, our quakings would be like the quakings of <hi>Beltaſhazar,</hi> and our tremblings as the tremblings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai: or we ſhould hide our faces from him as did <hi>Adam</hi> our Father. How ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible? how dreadfull? how angry is God with thoſe who look toward him for mercy without Chriſts Mediation? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly if God ſhould but enter into judgement for one ſin, ſhould but pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or weigh one iniquitie, none could ſtand before him. If the Angels are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, in reſpect of the puritie of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; how much more ſinfull or ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men? Man may offend or treſpaſſe againſt man, and man may plead for him: But if man ſinne againſt God, who ſhall plead for him but Chriſt? By him alone we have recourſe to the throne of grace for grace, and to the throne of mercie for mercy. Without him the heaven ſhould be as braſſe, and iron, ſo that our prayers could not enter into the celeſtiall Sanctuary, nor find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the preſence or ſight of God.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97216:53"/>Where now is the hand of mercy? the ſcepter of bountie? and the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anſwer of God to the conſcience? but in Chriſt who ſits at the right hand of the Father, making interceſſion for us. Wherefore if we want wiſdome, peace, and righteouſneſſe, remiſſion of ſins, and joy of the holy Ghoſt, let us look towards heaven, and remember that Chriſts oblation once offered is ſo prevalent, that through that we ſhall have an anſwer of what our ſouls deſire. Though we may hide our faces as did the Cherubims, in reſpect of our own vileneſſe, yet may we look up to God for ſpirituall bleſſings, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt with confidence. No child may go freer to his father, no wife to her husband, then we may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God through Jeſus Chriſt. Whileſt our prayers are weak, Chriſts mediation is ſtrong; and whileſt our performances deſerve to be denied, through Chriſts oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Heſter</hi> found acceptation, although the golden Scepter of <hi>Ahaſhucrus</hi> was not ſtretched forth: much more ſhall we find accepration, ſith that in Chriſt the Scepter of bountie is ſtretched forth;

                  <p n="1">1. REconciliation is an Act of the free and deare love of God, our heavenly, gracious, and clementious Father, whereby through the death, and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath reconciled us unto himſelfe; to the end, that we might enjoy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace and communion with himſelfe, through his beloved. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97216:54"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the bloud of Chriſt is the cauſe of Redemption from ſinne; ſo it is the cauſe of Reconciliation to God. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And (having made peace, through the bloud of his Croſſe) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelfe, by him, I ſay; whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The onely ſubject in whom we are reconciled to God our Father, is Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; ſith that in him alone God doth not impute our ſinnes to us. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ends of Reconciliation, are the peace of Conſcience, the dignitie of Chriſt our Mediator, and the faithfulls fruition of Gods preſence, which was obſcured or hidden from them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of iniquitie. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and broken downe the middle wall of partition betweene us.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. This gracious ſentence in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation proceeds from Gods decree, that it might be pronounced in Chriſt our

                  <p n="7">7. The meritorious, or formall cauſe, the precious &amp; deare bloud of the Lord Chriſt, that bought us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.

Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace is the cauſe of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the freeneſſe of love the cauſe of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; the freeneſſe of bountie the cauſe of glorification. What worth, what value, what dignitie hath there been in thee, O my ſoule? For in thy conſcience hath been impuritie, in thy will contradicencie; in thy affection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie; and in thy fleſh, impugnancie.

Yea, for in him is thy power, wiſedome, ſtrength, and felicitie, in him is thy peace, reſt, life, and glory; in him is thy redemption, wiſedome, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and excellencie.

It is an honour too great to be given to principalities, to powers, to dignities, to Mights, or to Dominions; this onely befits <hi>Iſraels</hi> eternall Shepheard, the Author of their peace, and Prince of their conſolation. This hath been the Fathers pleaſure, that as all their joyes, love, peace, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and promiſes ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Saints by Chriſt in the vale of miſerie: This hath been the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bountie, that the communion of the Saints, the perfection of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the coronation of his Martyrs, ſhould be given to his in him, in that ſtate ſo happie.

                  <p>I cry how long Lord, how long ſhall it be ere I ſee thy glorious face and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance.

Becauſe the battell is ſtrong betwixt thee and the black prince of death and darkneſſe, the world hates and contemnes thee, and Angels of light have made thee worſe then the filth of the earth, yet ſhalt thou not be diſmayed; for there is a Citie provided for thee, whoſe maker and builder is God: in which, there is the crowne of righteouſneſſe, the crowne of life, and the crown of glory; in which there is fellowſhip with the Angels, with the Saints, with the Father, and with Chriſt the beloved Mediatour and Reconciler: in which is everlaſting praiſe, eternall comforts, and infinite fruition. Therefore I will walke with the travellers, runne with the runners, and fight with the fighters, laying hold of eternall praiſe and glory, ſaying,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97216:78"/>with the lovers of free grace, the wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for mercie, and the poore captives of hope, praiſe be given to God our cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall, gracious, and bountifull Father; honour be aſcribed to Jeſus Chriſt, our propitious and benignous Mediatour, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Admiration of admirations! O wonder of wonders! O gift of gifts, that the high and holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the Father of eternall mercies, of incomprehenſible and infinite kindnes, who dwels in light in acceſſible, ſhould communicate his light and glory to poore diſtreſſed captives, who walked upon the dark mountains, who were bound by Law and juſtice to everlaſting chains under darknes, who were blinded by the fearfull king of terrors, that roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyon, whoſe dwelling and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in eternall wo and miſerie! O my ſoul, was not thy darkneſſe worſe then the darkneſſe of Egypt? was it not more terrible then the darkneſſe of the night ſeaſon? waſt thou not as blind as the Sodomites, yea thy blindneſſe worſe then the blindneſſe of the Aramites? In that day of darkneſſe and obſcuritie, thou ſaweſt nothing but ſinne, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and iniquitie; but hell, death, and calamitie; but juſtice, wrath, and furie; but deſtruction, woe and miſery: though the glory of God ſhowne in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97216:88"/>land of the living, though the beautie of Chriſt ſhowne amongſt the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet thou beheldeſt not his glory; but now he hath enlightned thee: when he became the day ſtarre in thy heart, a Sunne of brightneſſe in thy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his glory ſhowne in the face of Jeſus Chriſt upon thy conſcience? What light is like this light wherewith thy Father hath enlightned thee? not the light of the ſtarres; Chriſt the day ſtarre is thy illumination; not the light of the candle, the Spirit of Chriſt is to thee the Spirit of revelation: nor the light of the Sun, though it ſhine in the Meridian. That enlightneth the aire, this thy ſoul that contents thy eye, this thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſetteth and riſeth; this riſeth and never ſetteth; that draweth vapors from belowe, this draweth thy ſoule as high as the heavenly places: that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth Townes, Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, this enlightneth thee to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Citie, whoſe maker and builder is God. O my ſoule, is light ſowne for the righteous, and not for thee? Hath light appeared in a dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not to thee? Or hath Chriſt the Light of the world appeared, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97216:88"/>not to thee? Yea, for though thou waſt born blind, yet now thou ſeeſt: and though thou waſt encompaſſed with obſcuritie, yet now thou beholdeſt: what doeſt thou behold, yea what doſt thou not behold? For his grace is thy glory, his face thy comfort, his promiſe thy reſt, his Chriſt thy hope, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thy end, and the fruition of his face thy great felicitie. Thou ſaweſt the Sunne, whileſt the Sonne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was obſcured: and whileſt the Son of righteouſneſſe appeared, the Sunne in the midſt of the Planets was ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo that whileſt thou waſt deprived of the one, thou didſt enjoy the other: as the text relateth. <hi>For thy God enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his, and they ſhall reigne for evermore.</hi>

            <p>WHy did not <hi>Paul</hi> glory that he was an inheritor of an inheritance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and immarceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? why did he not glory that he was admitted to ſweetneſſe of communion and neerneſſe of union with his Lord and Mediatour? why did he not glorie that he had the gift of healing, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of Miniſterie, and the power in caſting out of evill ſpirits; but in bonds and chains for Jeſus ſake? (there hath been great cauſe wherefore) for this is a great and exceeding dignitie, greater then either Kingdome or Conſulſhip. For nothing is ſo glorious as chaines
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97216:91"/>about thoſe hands, as fetters about thoſe feet, as iron bonds about thoſe necks which are born for Jeſus cauſe. To be a priſoner for Jeſus, is better then to be an Apoſtle, then to be a Teacher, then to be an Evangeliſt. If any man love Chriſt, he knoweth what I ſay; if any man be raviſhed and inflamed with the love of his Maſter, he knoweth the force of thoſe bonds: he would rather be a priſoner for Chriſt, then to dwell in heaven; he ſheweth to them thoſe hands more bright then any gold, then any Kings Crowne; for a Crowne ſet with precious ſtones doth not ſo gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet out the head whereon it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as an iron chaine wherewith one is bound for Chriſts ſake. Perhaps this is more honourable then to ſet him upon the twelve thrones: perhaps this is more glorious then to ſet him at his right hand: perhaps this is more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then to enjoy all terrene and earthly bleſſings. But what ſpeak I of humaine things? I am aſhamed to compare riches and ornaments of gold to thoſe bonds; I am aſhamed to compare mountains of pearls to thoſe chains; I am aſhamed to equall Seas of riches to thoſe fetters. If
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97216:92"/>any man would give me heaven or ſuch ſufferings, I would chuſe thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. If one would place me with the Angels above, or with <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon, I would rather chuſe to be with <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon: if any one would make me one of thoſe powers that be about heaven; I would rather chuſe to be ſuch a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: I would gladly ſee thoſe chaines which the devils feare and tremble, and the Angels reverence: I would gladly reſt in thoſe places where thoſe bonds remain. Do I count <hi>Paul</hi> ſo bleſſed for that he was taken into Paradiſe, as I do for that he was caſt into priſon? No Or do I count him ſo bleſſed for that he was raviſhed with the joyes of heaven, as I count him bleſſed in impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? No. O my ſoule, if thou art brought to the Croſſe with theeves, if thou art carried to anſwer in chaines before Princes and Monarchs; if thou art adjudged worthy of death with the condemned, ſpet upon, buffeted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled; yea although by tranſ-formed. Angels of light: Notwithſtanding thoſe ſhall be thy glory; the gift of ſuffering is greater then the ſtaying of the Sunne and Moone, greater then the moving
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97216:92"/>of the world, then to conquer Satan, or drive away devils. The devils are not ſo grieved when they are driven away by faith; as when they ſee thee valiant and ſtout in bonds and fetters. How great rejoycing, how great honour, how great glory, how great pleaſure is it to be in bonds for ſuch a Saviour? O bleſſed hands, which are ſo adorned with thoſe unvaluable chaines. Doth our Lord ſay that they are bleſſed who raiſe the dead, or they are bleſſed who open the eyes of the blind? No: But they are bleſſed who ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake. They are now in heavineſſe, but their Lord will ſee them again; their hearts ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and their joy ſhall no man take from them. They are now deſpiſed, yet beloved: now abhorred. yet imbraced: now undervalued, yet eſteemed. What ſhall I ſay, O that I might have ſeen the cave where <hi>David</hi> was! O that I had ſeene the priſon where <hi>Peter</hi> was: or that I had ſeene the fierie fornace of thoſe worthie ſufferers, or the den of Lyons where <hi>Daniel</hi> was: then ſhould I have admired at the gracious hand and admirable providence of Chriſt to his poore ſufferers. The Lions
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97216:93"/>did honour <hi>Daniels</hi> ſuffering, the fierie flame did abate at the three Childrens enduring: the vipers did reverence <hi>Pauls</hi> chaine it was ſo glorious. Have the ſufferers for Chriſt loſt their names? they have a name written in the book of life. Have they loſt their libertie? they have the libertie of grace and glory. Have they loſt their lives? they have a life laid up with God in Chriſt. Have they loſt their treaſures? they have hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and glorious treaſures. And have they loſt all? they ſhall poſſeſſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Chriſt Lord of all. O my ſoule, whileſt others glories in riches, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in pleaſures, in vanities of the world, thou ſhalt glory in bonds, in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in chains, in ſcourges, in reproaches, in ſtonings, in ſhipwracks, and in all impoſements: for thy Lord hath ſaid in the world thou ſhalt have trouble; but with him thou ſhalt have peace, he will ſee thee again, thy heart ſhall rejoyce, and thy joy ſhall no man take from thee. Thou ſhalt therefore glory as much in thoſe chaines, as in the robe of righteouſneſſe, as in his precious blood, as in his rich inheritance, and in his faithfull promiſes: for though thou haſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97216:93"/>been a priſoner in Chriſt, yet not bound in Chriſt: though a priſoner to Chriſt, yet not bound by chaines of iron, but by bonds of love a priſoner of Chriſt: Sith thou haſt ſuffered reproaches, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, ſtoning and flight for his Names ſake. No marvell though the Apoſtles were more then conquerers; no marvell though they went rejoycing from the Councell: no marvell though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung in bonds and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Sith the preſence of Chriſt is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable in priſon as in heaven, the love of God as precious in priſon as in the heavenly places; and the chain of Chriſt in priſon more rich then a chaine of pearls and jewels: therefore the Apoſtle gloried in this chain. <hi>Phil.</hi> 9. <hi>Yet for loves ſake I rather beſeech thee, being ſuch a one as Paul the aged, and now alſo a priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
